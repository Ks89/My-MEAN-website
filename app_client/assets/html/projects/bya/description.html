BYAManager is a personal project that i realized in 2011 and updated more times during the years. It's a Multi-Platform and Multi-Language software dedicated to the "Apple World", that i developed for the blog called BiteYourApple.
This software is a GUI to download iOS firmwares and iTunes versions with some extra features.
It's legal, obviously, because all files are on Apple server. BYAManager gets files directly from Apple server to you.
<br/>
It's available in 3 languages: ITALIAN, ENGLISH and CZECH
<br/>
The entire list of features is available <a href="https://github.com/Ks89/BYAManager#features">HERE</a>.
<br/>
BYAManager uses <a href="https://github.com/Ks89/BYAUpdater">BYAUpdater</a> to update itself automatically!
<br/>
I presented this software in 2011 <a href="http://www.biteyourapple.net/2011/12/28/esclusiva-bya-biteyourapple-manager-beta-3/">HERE</a>
<br/>
Attention!!! I started this project on assembla.com with SVN. The source code and the commit's list are in Assembla in a private repository. This isn't important, because the code here on GitHub is better.
<br/>
I'm working on a Python script to sort the ipsw's links in the database.
This project is available <a href="https://github.com/Ks89/BYAMSorter">HERE</a>. 
In the future, i want to integrate this script in BYAManager.
